    "This pproject applies object detection and image classification to automatically detect scoring events in amateur basketball videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Finding all scoring highlights in an amateur basketball video is time consuming. Unlike professional games where each score triggers a game clock stoppage or replay, amateur games lack these built-in cues. This makes it difficult to spot scoring events. Our goal is to develop a system to automatically detect scoring events in those footages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Repository and Code Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "`cls_detection.py` is the script that inference on a video witht the YOLO+ResNet50 system, which returns the scoring timestamps and probabilities. \n",
    "Run `python cls_detection.py [YOLO_MODEL_PATH] [CLS_MODEL_PATH] [VIDEO_PATH]` with options like `--cls_conf_threshold` and `--save_result_vid` to process videos using YOLO and classification models with customizable settings.\n",
    "You can also try it in `detection_with_cls.ipynb`. We used this notebook to test the performance of YOLO+ResNet50  \n",

    "The ball center method has decent accuracy and recall, though it struggles when the basketball net blocks the ball inside the hoop, causing missed detections (high false negative rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire ball approach is further limited by the basketball net obstruction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We developed the trajectory technique to predict made shots by the ball path without needing to visually see inside the hoop. This improved false negatives but fundamentally cannot resolve false positives of balls passing behind/in-front of the hoop in 2D view.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize our project, we first experimented with different object detection models and then proposed combining a classification model for better performance. After training and evaluating candidate models, we narrowed down YOLOv8-Large and ResNet50 as top choices. We created two systems using these models for scoring detection and evaluated them on amateur basketball video dataset. However, issues around depth perspective, video quality, and generalization remain. Going forward, approaches such as model ensembles or temporal video analysis may better capture the intricacies of amateur basketball footage.\n",
